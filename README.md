# Predicting and Classifying Terrorism Incidents

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and predict global terrorism incidents using Python and Scikit-Learn.

## Project Overview
Terrorism poses significant challenges worldwide. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning, this project aims to predict and classify terrorism incidents to better understand their patterns and potentially aid in prevention efforts.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), an open-source database that includes information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START).

## Project Structure
- attack_types.ipynb: Notebook classifying different types of terrorist attacks.
- is_attack_successful.ipynb: Notebook predicting the success probability of terrorist attacks.
- Project-Presentation.pptx: Presentation summarizing the project's objectives, methodologies, and findings.

## Getting Started
To explore or replicate the analysis:
1) Clone the repository:
```git
git clone https://github.com/farukaplan/Predicting-and-Classifying-Terrorism-Incidents.git
```
```git
cd Predicting-and-Classifying-Terrorism-Incidents
```
2) Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```git
python -m venv env
```
```git
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
```
3) Install the required packages:
```git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4) Access the Jupyter notebooks:
```git
jupyter notebook
```

Open `attack_types.ipynb` and `is_attack_successful.ipynb` to review the analyses.

## Results
The project provides insights into various attack types and factors influencing the success of terrorist incidents. Detailed findings and visualizations are available within the notebooks and the project presentation.
